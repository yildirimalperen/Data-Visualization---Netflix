# Data-Visualization---Netflix

I worked on python for datavisualization and practiced on pandas and seaborn libraries.
I picked my dataset from Kaggle.com and processed Netflix data for visualization.


To summarize my work on this project; 
- I worked with countplot, lineplot and distribution plot and created graphs.
- With these graphs, I studied for cleaning data and creating new datasets.
